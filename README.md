# Forecast (forecast.py)

This program interacts with a United States National Weather Service
API to retrive a 10-day weather forecast and display it in a command
shell. It can be passed latitude and longitude coordinates or, if none
are passed, it will return the forcast for downtown
**Minneapolis, Minnesota**.

-----
Coordinates, if passed, can be seperated by a comma or a space, and
can include or exclude a '-' in front of the longitude coordinate.
